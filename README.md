In sequence, we focused on deploying a node. So, the nearcore project was cloned and compile using cargo build. We also generate some files in our directory as config.json and node_key.json. After that, we setup the aws and started running the node.

Then we logged in the near and setup the credentials to finally Start the validator node.
The logs that prove we did it are bellow:
